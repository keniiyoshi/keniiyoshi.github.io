			<h2 class="date"> Course Note | Sun. 14th Jan 2018</h2>
			<ul class="blog-content">
				<li>What do you guys think about the storyline?</li>
			  <li>Are the mnemonics (puns) easy/bizarre enough to remember?</li>
			  <li>Is the star wars element helpful?</li>
				<li>3 people suggested me to make the puns more explicit. </li>
			  <li>2 people suggested me to change the dialogues into the star-wars themed scroll up animation (perhaps through embedding iMovie YouTube video), along with a speed-setting and replay feature. There was another suggestion to show each dialogue one by one. Based on this feedback, I added a star wars crawl on an introduction scene of the project (I put instructions in the intro, and moved the About/Credit page to the last tab).</li>
			  <li>There was a suggestion to add gif file of Yoda. I will do so.</li>
			  <li>2 people suggested me to add character boxes for the dialogue. I will do that too.</li>
			  <li>There was a suggestion to make Luke antsy rather than Yoda, as Yoda is a symbol of patience. I will do that as well.</li>
			  <li>There was a suggestion to take out the ENTJ letters on the decision options. I will do that as soon as I organize my endings in the FINALE scene.</li>

			<h1 class="blog-title">Project Brainstorm</h1>
			<h2 class="date"> Course Note | Mon. 8th Jan 2018</h2>
			<div class="blog-content">There could be a character that guides the user to the map that aides story telling. mateo-same stories, different  perspective (Rashoumon style). Possible to have the map evolve as the user stays in the website more and accumulate knowledge. Could be cool for user to customize the map. juxtaposition of satellite image with 2D map. Maybe, a few minute long story cjould take place, where the character will show around places/tour.can we use green screen in campus? Have game-like experience. Scope of map (shanghai, or just podong/puxi?). Or learning clusters of chinese phrases localized on sites as stories. interactivity to simulate language interactions i.e. buying things like creampuff. user speaks to computer, and the computer gives back creampuff. A good stories involves person(s). Hopefully publish on Facebook. go back to sites to get more resource? Have a quest to learn geographical names.</div>
			<div class="blog-content">Note on storytelling: education stuff: Nancy Duerte. My project more focused on education like the parables of polygons. Better to incoporate conflict/problem (i.e. I don't know enough Mandarin to get around SHanghai nicely). What is (my bad Chinese), what could be (how much I want to be able to speaker given the amount of free time). Moments of reflection. emotion: empowering, exciting. audience? my FB friends.</div>

			<h1 class="blog-title">HW #3</h1>
			<h2 class="date"> HW | Fri. 5th Jan 2018</h2>
			<div class="my-div">WRITE a blog post describing the site/space/location you plan to focus on for Project #1. What "story" do you want to tell and why?</div>
			<div class="my-div special-div">Because learning Mandarin and Javascript has been my main focus so far in my J-term, I wanted to carry this onto my projects. As a result, for project 1, I plan to make an interactive map of Shanghai. In essence, the map would look like google maps (ideally with all the same features) PLUS other sensory features especially sound and videos. For example, I am planning to incorporate sounds of cooking and video of steaming buns from Yue garden from Juanary 7th tour in Shanghai. I am also planning to get many videos and sounds from Google for this, so it should be relatively feasible.</div>
			<div class="my-div special-div">The language learning aspect of this map is that the interactivity of it should help aid the learning of all the geograhical names in Shanghaik, especially those that are obscure for English speakers to remember. To further help memorization of names, I am thinking about adding features (again, accompanyied by sounds and animation) that effectively works as nmenomic devices. For example, inspired from a tour guide's explanation that "Tian" from "Tianzifang" means sheep, I would add an animation of sheep on a map near Tianzifang. Also, I can add pictures/sounds that rhymes with geographical names, such as adding a "Pudding" near Pudong.</div>

			<h1 class="blog-title">HW #2</h1>
			<h2 class="date"> HW | Thurs. 4th Jan 2018</h2>
			<div class="my-div">WRITE a blog post describing what you are most excited/interested/intrigued to see tomorrow and why. Be prepared to discuss in class.</div>
			<div class="my-div special-div">Shanghai Propaganda Poster Art Center should be particularly interesting for me, as it would suppliment my knowledge about Maoist China which I have studied in my IB History class (I studied as part of authoritarian party states, along with Stalinist USSR.). I'm excited to be able to see the posters similar to those that I have studied in my high school textbooks. The site of the First Communist Congress would interest me for similar reason. I read Ezra Vogel's biography about Deng Xiaoping as well, so the exhibit should suppliment my knowledge there too. Mission: Help guide a lost tourist by learning how to do that yourself. VERBS: navigate, learn, speak</div>

			<h2 class="date"> HW | Wed. 3rd Jan 2018</h2>
			<div class="my-div">DESCRIBE your most memorable educational experience pre-NYUAD. This could be a singular moment where you came to an epiphany-like realization or a drawn-out process where understanding was realized over a period of time. It could have happened within school or outside of any formal educational setting. Why is this your most memorable experience? Was the experience an 'explorable' one or not? Were elements of Papert's "Constructionism" involved? Explain why or why not?</div>
			<div class="my-div special-div">My most memorable educational experience happened while I was participating in Japan China Korea Youth History Experience Summer camp in the summer of 2012. The camp was held in the Chinese city of Dalian, and this was the first time for me to travel to China. In this week-long camp, among debating about historical issues centered around Japanese colonialism during and before WWII, I naively tried to learn many Chinese and Korean phrases, but mostly to no avail. However, there was one phrase that I actually nailed perfectly, which was a Korean phrase that was equivalent to "Thanks to you, I had a very nice day". When I said this to my Korean roommates during the camp, they were both suprised and impressed. One of them even gifted me his Korean instant noodles. This was the first time when I realized how rewarding it was to be able to communicate a foreign language. </div>

                My most memorable educational experience happened while I was participating in Japan China Korea Youth History Experience Summer camp in the summer of 2012. Speaking of memorable experiences, let me demonstrate how we might store and query such experiences in a SQL database:
                
                <pre><code class="sql">
-- Create a table to store international experiences
CREATE TABLE international_experiences (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    country VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50),
    event_name VARCHAR(100),
    year INT,
    learned_phrase VARCHAR(100),
    language VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert my experience
INSERT INTO international_experiences VALUES (
    1,
    'China',
    'Dalian',
    'Japan China Korea Youth History Experience Summer Camp',
    2012,
    'Thanks to you, I had a very nice day',
    'Korean'
);

-- Query to find experiences where I learned new phrases
SELECT country, city, learned_phrase, language
FROM international_experiences
WHERE learned_phrase IS NOT NULL;
                </code></pre>
